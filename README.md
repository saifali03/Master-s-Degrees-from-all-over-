    > The Jupyter notebook with the solutions to all the questions. The cells are already executed.
* __`functions`__
    > A folder containing all the .py files used and imported in the `main.ipynb`, in order to improve readability in reporting and efficiency in deploying the code. The folder includes:
    * __`crawler.py`__
        > The bot that browses the website, sending HTTP requests.
    * __`parser.py`__
        > The bot that scrapes informations in the website in order to create the dataframe we are working on.
    * __`engine.py`__
        > Module containing all the functions used to create the Search Engine for Q2.
    * __`functions.py`__
        > Module containing all the functions imported in the `main.ipynb` to solve the questions.
* __`map_courses.html`__
    > The map obtained as the result of Q4, displaying universities filtered through Q3 using the query 'data science'.
* __`CommandLine.sh`__
    > The command line scripts used to answer the questions.
* __`CommandLine_output.png`__
    > The image showing the outputs of the command line scripts.
* __`Q1 outputs`__
